	<h1 class = "title">Basic Explanation</h1>
	<p>This version of Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) follows all of the basic rules of RPS, but instead of being able to use any 
	option to throw Rock, Paper, or Scissors as many times as you want, you are given 12 cards to play that represent each respective throw 
	with 4 copies of each throw. </p>
	<p>Whenever a card is played and the round is resolved, the cards played are discarded until the end of the game. 
	Use the knowledge of what your opponent has played to gain the upper hand!</p>
